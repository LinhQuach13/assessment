# Technical Assessment

## Choosing the model:
This is a binary classification because it has two class labels (success or failure of hospital procedures).
- The classification algorithm used was a Random Forest Model for several reasons listed below: 
     - It is a robust model that is able to handle outliers and data that is not normally distributed.
     - This model is works well with a wide variety of data.
     - Other models such as the logistic regression model are not as versatile to a variety of datasets because it assumes linear relationships which may not be the case for this dataset.
     - This Random Forest model has a reduction in over-fitting compare to the Decision Tree model.
