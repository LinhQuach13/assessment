# Technical Assessment

## Assumptions in choosing model:
This is a binary classification because it has two class labels (success or failure of hospitals).
- The classification algorithm used was a Random Forest Model for several reasons listed below: 
     - It is a robust model that is able to handle outliers and data that is not normally distributed.
     - In addition, due to it being robust this model can handle a wide variety of data.
     - This model has a reduction in over-fitting compare to the decision tree model.
