    '''
    This function takes in the X_train, y_train subsets, 3 attributes, and the parameters as listed below for the Random Forest Model,
    then runs it through the Random Forest model object. The predictions (True/False) are outputted here.
    Parameters:
- n_est: int, default=100
    The number of trees in the forest.

       The default value of ``n_estimators`` changed from 10 to 100
       in 0.22.

- c : {"gini", "entropy"}, default="gini"
    The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria are
    "gini" for the Gini impurity and "entropy" for the information gain.
    Note: this parameter is tree-specific.

- max_dp : int, default=None
    The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
    all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
    min_samples_split samples.

- mss : int or float, default=2
    The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:

    - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
    - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
      `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
      number of samples for each split.

       Added float values for fractions.

- msl : int or float, default=1
    The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
    A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
    least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
    right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
    especially in regression.

    - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
    - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
      `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
      number of samples for each node.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.18
       Added float values for fractions.

- min_weight_fraction_lf : float, default=0.0
    The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
    the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
    equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

- max_ft : {"auto", "sqrt", "log2"}, int or float, default="auto"
    The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

    - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
    - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and
      `round(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each
      split.
    - If "auto", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
    - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)` (same as "auto").
    - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
    - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.

    Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
    valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
    effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.

- max_leaf_nd : int, default=None
    Grow trees with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
    Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
    If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

- min_impurity_dc : float, default=0.0
    A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
    greater than or equal to this value.

    The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::

        N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                            - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)

    where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of
    samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the
    left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.

    ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,
    if ``sample_weight`` is passed.

    .. versionadded:: 0.19

- min_impurity_splt : float, default=None
    Threshold for early stopping in tree growth. A node will split
    if its impurity is above the threshold, otherwise it is a leaf.

    .. deprecated:: 0.19
       ``min_impurity_split`` has been deprecated in favor of
       ``min_impurity_decrease`` in 0.19. The default value of
       ``min_impurity_split`` has changed from 1e-7 to 0 in 0.23 and it
       will be removed in 1.0 (renaming of 0.25).
       Use ``min_impurity_decrease`` instead.

- bootstrp : bool, default=True
    Whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. If False, the
    whole dataset is used to build each tree.

- oob_score : bool, default=False
    Whether to use out-of-bag samples to estimate the generalization score.
    Only available if bootstrap=True.

- n_jb : int, default=None
    The number of jobs to run in parallel. :meth:`fit`, :meth:`predict`,
    :meth:`decision_path` and :meth:`apply` are all parallelized over the
    trees. ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend`
    context. ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary
    <n_jobs>` for more details.

- random_st: int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
    Controls both the randomness of the bootstrapping of the samples used
    when building trees (if ``bootstrap=True``) and the sampling of the
    features to consider when looking for the best split at each node
    (if ``max_features < n_features``).
    See :term:`Glossary <random_state>` for details.

- verbo : int, default=0
    Controls the verbosity when fitting and predicting.

- warm_st : bool, default=False
    When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit
    and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole
    new forest. See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.

- cw : {"balanced", "balanced_subsample"}, dict or list of dicts, default=None
    Weights associated with classes in the form ``{class_label: weight}``.
    If not given, all classes are supposed to have weight one. For
    multi-output problems, a list of dicts can be provided in the same
    order as the columns of y.

    Note that for multioutput (including multilabel) weights should be
    defined for each class of every column in its own dict. For example,
    for four-class multilabel classification weights should be
    [{0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 5}, {0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 1}] instead of
    [{1:1}, {2:5}, {3:1}, {4:1}].

    The "balanced" mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust
    weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data
    as ``n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))``

    The "balanced_subsample" mode is the same as "balanced" except that
    weights are computed based on the bootstrap sample for every tree
    grown.

    For multi-output, the weights of each column of y will be multiplied.

    Note that these weights will be multiplied with sample_weight (passed
    through the fit method) if sample_weight is specified.

- ccpAlpha : non-negative float, default=0.0
    Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning. The
    subtree with the largest cost complexity that is smaller than
    ``ccp_alpha`` will be chosen. By default, no pruning is performed. See
    :ref:`minimal_cost_complexity_pruning` for details.


- maxSamples : int or float, default=None
    If bootstrap is True, the number of samples to draw from X
    to train each base estimator.

    - If None (default), then draw `X.shape[0]` samples.
    - If int, then draw `max_samples` samples.
    - If float, then draw `max_samples * X.shape[0]` samples. Thus,
      `max_samples` should be in the interval `(0, 1)`
